Advice Generator in React

Designed at 1440 by 900 pixels for desktop, 375 by 700 pixels for mobile. This program is a simple website that uses the Advice API to generate advice prompts.

3/1/24: Started and completed the build of the website.

Peer Review: George - You didn't need to use a random for the api fetch, it gives you a random advice anyways, you also never used any your interface for giving property types. Your code works I suppose but the assignment reequired us to include them.
